## Histogram
Histogram is a representation of distribution of numerical data.
### Steps to construct an histogram:
1. Bin the range of values : Divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals.
2. Count how many values fall into each interval.

In step two, we count the *frecuency* of each interval, in the bin, a rectangle is that interval with height proporional to the frecuency.

It's good to check the data in several bin widths to know how it behaves.
