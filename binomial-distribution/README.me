# Simulations of problems shown in the 3Blue1Brown series of videos about Probability

In the `making_data.jl` i ran several times the experiment, having around 60% every time, and the most rated value was 10 out of 10, with samples of 10 reviews, on the ohter hand, with review of 50, i got 48 to be the most frequent value; with samples of 100 reviews, the most frequent number was between 94 and 97.
The success rate was the same everytime: 0.95.
